#Global Life Expectancy Predictive Analytics
The main goal for this project was to perform exploratory data analysis, build dashboards, and apply machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy using global healthcare and economic data.

Why Life expectancy are important ?
Life expectancy is a key indicator of the overall health of a population. 
It is often used as a measure of a country's level of development and quality of life.
Life expectancy influences economic planning, especially in terms of pensions, retirement planning, and long-term care.
On a global scale, life expectancy helps international organizations identify areas of need and prioritize health initiatives, such as disease prevention.
